      <h1>Social Mobility Index</h1>
      <h2>The Twitter Social Mobility Index is a measure of social distancing and travel derived from Twitter data. We use public geolocated Twitter data to measure how much a user travels in a given week. We compute the standard deviation of Twitter geolocated tweets per week, and aggregate the data over an entire population to produce a metric for the US as a whole and for individual states and cities. </h2>
